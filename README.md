# Compopulate
**This is a work in progress. Use at your own risk.**

Associate `[Compopulate.Att]` with serialized component fields that are only meant to reference a component on the same gameObject. Run Compopulate to automatically fill them with `gameObject.GetComponent` and monitor discrepancies like missing or unexpected references.
